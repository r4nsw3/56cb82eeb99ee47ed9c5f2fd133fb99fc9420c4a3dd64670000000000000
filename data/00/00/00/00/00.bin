  |   Cyber Protocol is an arcade puzzle game set in Cyberpunk scenario     |
  |   with a strong and dynamic gameplay. You impersonate the main hero,    |
  |   whose mission is to bring his Android friend (G0X6) back to life by   |
  |   activating the protocol.                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The team has put every effort to turn each of 100 levels into a       |
  |   new, original challenge, not just with different setups, but also     |
  |   with new traps with different mechanics which could be used in        |
  |   various ways. The plan was that each time you go through a stage,     |
  |   you will get as involved as the first time.                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Share the fun with your family and friends - Cyber Protocol invites   |
  |   up to 4 players to take up the challenge locally! Be careful, only    |
  |   the best hackers can pass it without harm.                            |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Try hacking the system in the arcade mode at an increased pace and    |
  |   with limited lives. The task is hard, but if you are good enough,     |
  |   you can get your place in the top 20 global ranking of cyber          |
  |   hackers!                                                              |

  |   Don't worry - we got you covered! Throw away your old, dusty          |
  |   console, progress in the game and travel back in time to the 80's     |
  |   by changing game themes and sounds.                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   If you want to relax after the hard work of hacking, sit back and     |
  |   listen to the Cyber Protocol's Synthwave and 8bit soundtracks         |
  |   before going to the next challenge!                                   |
